# Recover Device and Setting it to Hotspot Mode 

# Window Time

<div class="description">

Every device has a window time of 60 seconds giving the users a chance to recover the device if the device was moved, or the wrong wifi credential was entered. Every time a device reboots there will be a period of time where the device will be in hotspot mode. If the device is unregistered this window time will not matter but if it is previously set up and registered then the window time will always be applied every reboot.
