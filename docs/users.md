# Account Users Management

<div class="description">

In the manage users tab of the panel, the admin can monitor each account user. Here, the admin can view the name, email, specific roles, and status of each account user.

The user and admin accounts differ slightly from one another. Account sharing is not accessible to the user account, but it is to the admin account thus it can check which accounts have been shared. Only the devices, groups, media library, and playlist are accessible via the user account.
