# Accounts management

<div class="description">

The added accounts by the distributor along with the demo account which contains a variety of registered devices are listed on the manage accounts tab of the panel together with their important details, such as the account name, number of licenses used, and their default email address.

There are no access restrictions on the distributor account, every account that is available on the digital barricade website can be managed by the distributor.
1 device is limited to 1 license. This ensures that each device must have its license to access and utilize the software.
