# Layouts Manager

<div class="description">

The Layouts Management page is designed for the editing, arrangement, and configuration of digital media into a layout that's ready for deployment. Here, you're provided with a canvas capable of handling various media typesâ€”text, images, videos, and playlists. These can be organized into one of two layout types: Normal Mode, which displays the entire layout on a device, and Areas Mode, where media is positioned within predefined areas, primarily for synchronized displays. You can then publish your layout to either a specific device or a group of devices.
