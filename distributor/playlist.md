        The distributor can set the name and the display size for the playlist. When creating a playlist, a playing mode must be chosen. It can be duration based, which only has 20 seconds default duration and schedule/time based, with the distributor setting the timetable for playing the playlist from Monday through Sunday.

        When the add an item button is clicked, it will direct the distributor to a new modal presenting a variety of customization options for the playlist. Among these options, the distributor can set a display text to present necessary information effectively. The position of the display text can be adjusted using X and Y coordinates, and for added flexibility, its orientation can be reversed via the reverse switch. To manage playlist visibility, there is an active switch that indicates whether the playlist is currently active or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, a dropdown menu is included in the modal to pick the preferred language for spoken sentences, enabling automated translation and vice versa. The distributor can control the display text's look by changing the font's size, style, and color to match their intended result. Distributors may also choose a variety of background color for the display text or use the uploaded media asset/s as the background to improve aesthetic appeal. Once all changes have been made, a reload preview button may be used to see how the display text will look after making the changes.
