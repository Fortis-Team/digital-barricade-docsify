<h1>Account Users Management</h1>
<div class="description">
    <p>
       In the manage users tab of the panel, the distributor and admin can monitor each account user. Here, the distributor and admin can view the name, email, specific roles, and status of each account user.
    </p>
    <p>
       The admin account and the user/customer accounts are slightly different. Account sharing is not accessible to the user/customer account, but it is to the admin account thus it can check which accounts have been shared. Only the devices, groups, media library, and playlist are accessible via the user/customer account.
