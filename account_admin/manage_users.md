<h1>Managing account users</h1>
<div class="description">
    <p>
       In the manage users tab of the panel, the admin can monitor each account user. Here, the admin can view the name, email, specific roles, and status of each account user.
    </p>
    <p>
       The admin account and the user/customer accounts are slightly different. Account sharing is not accessible to the user/customer account, but it is to the admin account thus it can check which accounts have been shared. Only the devices, groups, media library, and playlist are accessible via the user/customer account.
    </p>
    <p>
       Except for the admin account, all other accounts can be managed by the admin account, which means it can change the roles of other accounts and reset their passwords.

<h1>Invite new user</h1>
<div class="description">
    <p>
       The admin account can add a new user by clicking the invite user button at the account user interface. A modal will then appear, requiring the admin to provide their name, and email address, and select their role to either user or admin. The newly invited user account can navigate through the digital barricade website limited to their given role.
