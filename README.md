## Distributor

> The distributor plays a crucial role in overseeing multiple accounts. The distributor has access to a comprehensive view of all added accounts, including a demo account holding various registered devices. All the information of the accounts are accessible through the "manage accounts" tab on the panel. Important details such as account names, number of licenses used, and default email addresses, are listed for easy reference. A notable feature is the absence of access restrictions on the distributor account, granting them the authority to manage any account available on the digital barricade website. To ensure fair and individual utilization of the software, a one-device-to-one-license policy is strictly upheld. Each device must possess its unique license to gain access and employ the software's functionalities. This system guarantees proper software management and control, safeguarding the integrity of the digital ecosystem.

## Admin Account

> The "Manage Users" tab in the panel provides the distributor with comprehensive oversight of each account user. Within this tab, the distributor gains access to crucial information such as the user's name, email, specific roles, and current status. It's worth noting that there are some distinctions between the admin account and the user/customer accounts. While the admin account enjoys the privilege of accessing account sharing information, this feature is restricted for user/customer accounts. Consequently, the admin account holds the capability to track which accounts have been shared. Moreover, the user/customer account has limited accessibility, encompassing only devices, groups, media library, and playlists. However, apart from the distributor account, the admin account wields full control over all other accounts. This includes the ability to modify roles and reset passwords for added security and management efficiency.
